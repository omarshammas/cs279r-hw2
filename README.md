###Experiment Design:

Each task begins by clicking a "next" button in the center of the screen (difficult to center exactly because we don't know the dimensions of the turks computer). Timer starts when the subject is presented with the name and icon for a target (it may be presented as part of the doc, or in a sidebar). Incorrect selections will produce some sort of feedback (maybe a beep, or some banner).

2 blocks of tasks: Familiarization (to build spatial memory) and Performance
2 sets of commands (1 for each block): 6 commands spread across 3 different tabs. 3 in home, 2 in insert, 1 in view. 

The same set will be used for familiarization and performance with Ribbons/CommandMaps. Then the other set will be used for familiarization and performance with Ribbons/CommandMaps. The ordering of the set and interface will be counterbalanced using a Latin square.

Familiarization block consists of 30 tasks (1 command set of 6 commands * 5 trials). Performance block consists of 90 tasks using the same command set as the previous familiarization round (1 command set of 6 commands * 15 trials). The ordering of commands will be randomized, but in the case of ribbons we will ensure that a given ordering of commands will cause a parent switch 50% of the time.

After each performance section, participants must complete an NASA-TLX worksheet, and at the end of the experiment they must select CommandMaps or Ribbons as their preference.
